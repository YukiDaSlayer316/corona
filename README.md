# Goal of this project

Every living organism is made of ADN , a long sequence of character called nucleotides, represented by the letter A, T, G or C. Each groupment of 3 nucleotides is called a codon, which reprensent an amino acid. In total, there are 24 combinations of nucleotides (4x3x2). However, when looking in the scientific litterature, there are only 20 amino acids listed. Our first goal will be to understand what happened to those 4 missing amino acid by analyzing the ADN of the corona virus. Then, we will transcribe each nucleotide sequence into their respective amino acid in order to recompose the corona virus. To vizualize it, we will use the biopython library
